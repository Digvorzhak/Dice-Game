"Crazy Dices"

"Crazy Dices" is a small game I have made in Vanilla JS and is designed for two players.

Background music: MapleStory - Reverse City


Game Instructions:

In your turn - roll the dice (at least once) and accumulate the result in "current"

You can roll again or click "HOLD" to save the points from your current round and end your turn.

Note! If you get 6-6 - you will lose all your current score and the turn will go to your opponent.

If you managed to reach exactly the target score - you win! If you passed it - you lose.
